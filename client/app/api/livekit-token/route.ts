/** Mints a LiveKit join token. Server-side only — holds LIVEKIT_API_SECRET,
 * which the browser never sees.
 *
 * The identity is derived from the caller's own session, NEVER from a query
 * parameter. It used to be `?identity=whatever-you-type`, which meant
 * anyone could join as anyone — and now that the agent attributes each
 * spoken turn to a participant identity (and may use that person's private
 * sources to answer), a forgeable identity would be a way to read someone
 * else's data by simply typing their name.
 *
 * Guests are still allowed: no token means a guest identity, which the
 * agent treats as viewer-level with workspace-scoped sources only.
