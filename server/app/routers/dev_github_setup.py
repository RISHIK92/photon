"""One-time GitHub App creation via GitHub's "manifest" flow. Not part of
the product — an operator visits /dev/github-app/new once, clicks
"Create GitHub App" on GitHub's own site, and gets redirected back here
with credentials to paste into .env. Never linked from the product UI;
mounted only outside production (see main.py).

Why this exists at all: registering a GitHub App normally means filling
out a multi-field form by hand on GitHub's site. The manifest flow lets
us pre-fill everything (name, permissions, redirect URLs) and reduces the
operator's part to one click.
