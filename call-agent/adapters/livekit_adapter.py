"""The one TransportAdapter implementation we ship. Wraps a LiveKit Agents
1.x AgentSession: joins the room, wires Deepgram STT/TTS + Silero VAD,
intercepts every user turn to hand off to the orchestrator instead of
letting LiveKit's own LLM node run, and separately watches for a
screen-share video track (source == SCREEN_SHARE, never the camera track)
to feed on_frame at a low, state-dependent frame rate.

Everything platform-specific lives in this one file. adapters/base.py is
