"""The transport boundary (CLAUDE.md Section 5 / build plan Section 5).

Four methods, two callbacks. That's the whole interface a call platform
has to satisfy for the Company Brain to work over it:

- `TransportAdapter` — implemented by a platform-specific adapter
  (`livekit_adapter.py` today; a hypothetical `recall_adapter.py` for
  Zoom/Meet/Teams later, same shape). Called BY the orchestrator to act:
  speak a line, cancel mid-utterance on barge-in, make a one-off
  announcement, or publish a structured event out to whatever UI the
  platform gives the participants.

  `publish_event` is the fourth method, added for the live trace panel.
  Speech is the agent's answer to the human; this is everything *about*
  the answer (which tool is running, how long it took) that belongs on a
  screen rather than in someone's ear. A platform with no data channel
  can implement it as a no-op and lose only the panel, not the call.
- `SessionCallbacks` — implemented by the orchestrator (`orchestrator.py`).
  Called BY the adapter to report events: a piece of finalized/interim
  speech was heard, or a video frame arrived (tagged screen vs camera so
  the orchestrator can ignore a stray webcam frame).

`orchestrator.py` imports this module (it's the shared contract) but never
a concrete adapter — it only ever holds a `TransportAdapter`-shaped
reference and calls the three methods. The actual transport-blindness
constraint lives one level up: the Company Brain (`server/app/agent`,
`server/app/tools`) talks to this whole service over plain HTTP and must
never import anything from `call-agent/` at all.
