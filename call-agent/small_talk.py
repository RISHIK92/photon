"""Deterministic, zero-latency triage for open-mic speech.

With the wake word gone (explicit user request), EVERY finalized utterance
reaches the agent — including "Hello. How are you?" and "one sec, the
phone." Sending those through the full pipeline cost a real measured 4.5s
(2.4s planning + a 660ms search_docs + 1.4s compose) to answer a greeting,
and worse, it means the agent talks over people who weren't addressing it.

So: classify locally first. No LLM call, no network, no tools — a regex
pass costs microseconds and cannot fail closed.

The bias is deliberately asymmetric. Misclassifying a real question as
chatter is BAD (the agent silently ignores a customer), so every rule here
is conservative: short utterances only, and anything carrying a question
mark, an interrogative, or a product/account word always falls through to
the full pipeline no matter what else it matches.
